## Component Reuse (Codex + Claude)

When implementing UI or shared behavior, actively look for existing reusable components, helpers, or shared styles.

Look closely in frontend/component/shared to see the list of shared components.  

If an existing reusable component can cover most or all of the requested behavior, ask the user for confirmation before building a custom version or duplicating functionality.

Prefer extending or composing existing shared components over creating new bespoke ones unless explicitly requested.
